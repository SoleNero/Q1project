* I'm using Bands In Town API to display local live music events (within 50 miles) and to provide relevant details of event.
* Other technology I'm using:
  * Materialize Framework
  * JavaScript
  * jQuery
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * Deployed on Surge
* Responsive cross browser that looks great on any sized device
* Stretch goals: 
  * Google Map API to display events on an interactive map,
  * Geolocation,
